                <h1>The First 25 Years</h1>
                <strong><small>I grew up in the only major city in eastern Washington state, called Spokane. I am the younger of two siblings, my brother being 
                    my senior by about 4 years. My mom worked as a nurse(now retired) at a major hospital in town, while my dad worked (again, retired)
                    selling natural gas to large consumers such as paper plants, hospitals, etc.
                <br>    
                    I was an above average student, but always found time for friends and sports in addition to the textbook. I played trombone
                    starting in 5th grade, and band was a large part of my life well into undergrad. In high school, video games were a big part of my life,
                    as Halo 3 and Rock Band with friends were everyday activities. After high school graduation in 2009, I attended Washington State University for a year, 
                    learning plenty about why I dislike Pullman(the campus town) in addition to my subject matter. By Thanksgiving 2009, I knew that
                    a change was required and I transferred to the University of Portland, a small catholic university on the north bank of the Wilamette.
                    I completed a B.S. degree in Civil Engineering, and focusing on geotechnical engineering. After graduation in 2014, I took a year off
                    to work and travel. I was accepted to the University of Washington(Seattle) masters program for geotechnical engineering, which I 
                    took on and completed in 2016.

                <h1>Working Life</h1>
                
                
                <strong>Ive been fortunate to have some great jobs along the way. The following is a breakdown, from first, to current.</strong>
                <ol id="working-list">
                    <li>Lifeguard,Parks Department, Spokane WA</li>
                    <li>Lifeguard, A Golf and Country Club, Spokane WA</li>
                    <li>Pavement Rater, Spokane Streets, Spokane, WA</li>
                    <li>Geotechnical Intern, Geotech Engineering Firm, Spokane, WA</li>
                    <li>Geotechnical Engineer I, Large Environmental Firm, Seattle, WA</li>
                    <li>Field Engineer, Small specialty drilling contractor, Various</li>

                </ol>
                
                <h3>
                <strong><small>After grad school, I took on my first real engineering job. The salary was low, but I worked
                    hard designing shoring systems for excavations. After a year or so, I decided it was time to try getting back to my
                    hometown of Spokane, so started applying in the area. I hired on at a drilling contractor that was based in Spokane, 
                    but it was a traveling job. I assisted with project management tasks for 6 months in upstate New York, 
                    followed by a 4 year stint in eastern San Diego county. This employer specialized in helicopter supported 
                    construction, which made for made for some interesting work. I flew in helicopters,
                    worked under a sky-crane (THEY ARE HUUUGE!!, see below), and have worked through some tough challenges to 
                    accomplish construction in such remote areas. 
                    <br>
                    Along the way, I met a fabulous human, a lawyer who lived a couple hours north of me. So every weekend, I would drive the company
                    car the 2 hours north to go on a date, and then stay the weekend, and now stay together for life. I proposed to Shelby in late 
                    September of last year, and we are scheduled to wed in July of this year, shortly after my Coding Temple coding bootcamp concludes.

                <h1>Soccer</h1>
                
                <p>Growing up, I played tons of soccer. I became the regular starter in goal, and once that happened became a goalie for life. 
                    I have not played in a few years, but would love to continue playing and plan to join a mens league as life allows. After
                    falling in love with the game and not playing as frequently, I still wanted to witness some of the magic of the beautiful game.
                    I stumbled onto a smaller team from Wales that had just been promoted, and I loved their emblem/crest. That was it, and I was hooked. I 
                    still wake up early on Saturdays to watch Swansea City, win lose or draw. We have an exciting team that my see a return to the 
                    premier league under an exciting new manager and a young and improving side.
